## Hello dear!


### How to use
1. In order to run this Web Api you should clone this repository to your local machine.
2. After clonning you should open Git Bash and navigate up to the folder "aubay_sgt".
3. In this folder run the command `dotnet run --project src/api/api.csproj` and wait the application to run.
4. The application running well should show the url to be accessed to you to see the results. Use this url in the browser address bar or in any software used to make http calling, like Postman.
5. Wait for the results.


### Enhancements
1. I would propose to the Hacker News to give the options to retrieve the Best Stories already ordered.
2. Another thing to could be done is showing the results as soon as possible, even it's one by one with the list being increased.
